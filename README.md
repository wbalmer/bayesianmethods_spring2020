Notes: Much of this repository rests on the foundations of astroML and its associated textbook (linked above). The end goal of my independent study was to construct and write a lab introducing bayesian satistics to an introductory data science (with astronomical applications) course. Another product of the independent study was using a bayesian MCMC in order to fit a linear regression to a censored dataset (gathered from the WIYN 0.9m telescope, reduced and periodigram analyzed by myself and a classmate), in order to show that very low mass field dwarfs exhibit excess H-alpha flux. Feel free to contact me if you're curious about this application.
