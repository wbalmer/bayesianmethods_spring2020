# bayesian methods
Repository for Special Topics: Bayesian methods in Astronomy, ASTR490, Spring 2020 \
Instructor: A. Gianninas \
Textbook: [Statistics, Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691198309/statistics-data-mining-and-machine-learning-in-astronomy)

Notes: Much of this repository rests on the foundations of astroML and its associated textbook (linked above). The end goal of my independent study was to construct and write a lab introducing bayesian satistics to an introductory data science (with astronomical applications) course.
